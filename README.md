# GitHub_UsersList
This is a project for Access App Exercise
<br/><br/>
## Progress
The first thing I did is studying GitHub API Documentation. Used Postman to test the API URL, and figured out how the parameters working. I used to use MVC architecture. This is my first time tried using MVVM architecture. And I spent most of the time to deal with networking issues fetching data from the server. That's why I spent almost 8 hours to deal with networking. After got data successfully I start to deal with the user interface. I spend lots of time generating cell shadow and spacing between the cell. About the shadow, I had tried 3 methods. I read lots of Stack Overflow. There will always be some problems. At last, I used [Mayank Gupta's way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cubXeDj0LPI).

## Time I had used:
- Study GitHub API Documentation: 1 hour
- Networking: 8 hours
- How to display cell shadow and spacing between cell: 6 hours
- User interface: less than 1 hour
<br/><br/>
## What I had tried and learned during this exercise:
- GitHub API
- MVVM: I have never used this before.
- Rest API - Fetch data from the server.
- Display cell shadow and spacing between cell by UIView.
